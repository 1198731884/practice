\section{Future Improvements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Since we assume a fixed transport for each tour group while establishing the model and consider the tour's choice of modes of transportation to be random, the fact that there is a selection of tours of the rafts and motorboats was proportionate. If we can get historical data on river rafting, we will be able to find out the possibility of choosing two modes of transport for any group of tourists and figure out the patterns of travel days for travelers, and these results will make our model more accurate\\
\item In this paper, we establish a traditional goal of two-goal optimization, which may have some limitations. We consider that a cellular automaton model can be used. We will set some parameters of the cellular automata by the laws of presentation in the historical data and use them to simulate the tour of the Grand River. In this way, we allow visitors to freely choose the length of travel time, departure date and mode of transport and minimize the number of collisions, which will give tourists a high degree of satisfaction. Finally, we can find the best travel program from this model.
