\section{Strengths and weaknesses}
\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The model ensures maximum utilization of campgrounds and the concept of minimizing exposure quantifies the concept of "touch";
	\item Put forward many maths to solve the problem matrices: unit camping matrices, camping matrices, materiel battalion matrices, and the establishment of dual-objective optimization model;
	\item The carrying capacity of rivers is defined by the number of campsites, and the number of campsites is a constant. Inspired by the definition of tourism carrying capacity, we introduced the number of encounters to quantify the carrying capacity of rivers.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Model operation is more difficult, so we can only draw approximate results;
	\item Ignore the fact that some plans are implemented more than once. If you want to make the model more realistic, consider the case where the number of planned executions is greater than 1;
	\item The model has some limitations in practice.
\end{itemize}
