To the management of the Grand River:\\

With the rise of rafting and the growing economic benefits it generates, the river management urgently needs a viable itinerary to capitalize on river resources. With the rise of rafting and the growing economic benefits it generates, river management urgently needs a feasible itinerary to capitalize on river resources. We now know that river management hopes to have more boat trips into the river during the long rafting season. At the same time, from the safety point of view of tourists, there should be as few collisions as possible among the vessels that the tour groups should take and the river management department hopes to enjoy the camping experience in each field trip; at the same time, a camp can only accommodate one trip at a time group.
\par From the above analysis, we provide a schedule for river management based on a two-objective optimization model. We find that the rivers described by river management are very similar to those of the Lees Ferry (Mile 0) to Diamond Creek (Mile 225) in the Grand Canyon. With reference to the distribution of campgrounds, we assume that there are 38 camps in the main camp and they are located along the banks of the river Evenly distributed. By running our model at this time, the Grand River can accommodate 918 trips throughout the rafting season when no more than 10 collisions occur with the tours. What needs to be pointed out is that when we solve the model, we weaken the second optimization goal (minimize the number of collisions), and we can further adjust the solution according to the implementation effect of the solution by changing its value. This makes our model have greater flexibility. In addition, our model fixes the way travelers travel and their journey dates, which may reduce visitor satisfaction. But we need to tell you that when it comes to letting the traveler's journey go by them,which can cause considerable disruption and reduce the carrying capacity of the river. However, nightly camping and daily drifting hours of tourists can be up to their own discretion, thus making up for the freedom of choice for tourists.
\par Finally, I hope our solution can help your company.
